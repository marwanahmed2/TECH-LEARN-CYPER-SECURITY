  <p>
    is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices,
    electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks.
     It's also known as information technology security or electronic 
     information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, 
     from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.</p>

  <p class="vfc" >
    The&#160;global&#160;cyber&#160;threat&#160;continues&#160;to&#160;evolve&#160;at&#160;a&#160;rapid&#160;pace,&#160;with&#160;a&#160;rising&#160;number&#160;of data breaches each year. A report by RiskBased Security revealed that a shocking 7.9 billion records have been exposed by data breaches in the first nine months of 2019 alone. This figure is more than double (112%) the number of records exposed in the same period in 2018.

Medical services, retailers and public entities experienced the most breaches, with malicious criminals responsible for most incidents. Some of these sectors are more appealing to cybercriminals because they collect financial and medical data, but all businesses that use networks can be targeted for customer data, corporate espionage, or customer attacks.

With the scale of the cyber threat set to continue to rise, global spending on cybersecurity solutions is naturally increasing. Gartner predicts cybersecurity spending will reach $188.3 billion in 2023 and surpass $260 billion globally by 2026. Governments across the globe have responded to the rising cyber threat with guidance to help organizations implement effective cyber-security practices.

In the U.S., the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has created a cyber-security framework. To combat the proliferation of malicious code and aid in early detection, the framework recommends continuous, real-time monitoring of all electronic resources.

The importance of system monitoring is echoed in the “10 steps to cyber security”, guidance provided by the U.K. government’s National Cyber Security Centre. In Australia, The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) regularly publishes guidance on how organizations can counter the latest cyber-security threats.

        <p>Malware means malicious software.<br> One of the most common cyber threats, malware is <br> software that a cybercriminal or hacker has created to disrupt or damage <br> a legitimate user’s computer. Often spread via an unsolicited email attachment<br>or legitimate-looking download, malware may be used by cybercriminals to make money <br>or in politically motivated cyber-attacks.
